## Welcome to the first module of ProductLab!

We're excited to have you on board. In this module, you'll learn some of the basics of development.

## Overview of GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform that allows developers to share and collaborate on projects. It's also a great place to learn about new technologies and projects.

## Navigating a GitHub repo

To navigate a GitHub repo, you can use the following steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository page.
2. Click on the **Code** tab.
3. Browse through the files and folders in the repository.
4. To view a file, click on it.
5. To view the history of a file, click on the **History** tab.
6. To make changes to a file, click on the **Edit** button.
7. Make your changes and save the file.
8. To commit your changes, click on the **Commit** button.
9. To push your changes to the remote repository, click on the **Push** button.

## Getting started

To get started, we recommend that you clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a copy of the repository on your computer. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open it in a code editor and start working on the exercises.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any trouble navigating the GitHub repo or working on the exercises, please don't hesitate to ask for help. We have a team of mentors who are happy to assist you.

## Have fun!

We hope you enjoy this module of ProductLab. Learning about product development is a lot of fun, and we're excited to help you get started.
