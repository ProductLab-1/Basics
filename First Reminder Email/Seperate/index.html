   <h1>Hi Everyone,</h1>
    <br>
    <p> We’re one week into the Basics take-home work! Hopefully, it’s been going smoothly for everyone, but if it’s not, remember to ask questions in the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7a47d6c4a6ed47eb8d1ea57c53f31f86%40thread.tacv2/Questions?groupId=144988bd-3c1d-41e0-a2db-d300554d9f1c&tenantId=5b973f99-77df-4beb-b27d-aa0c70b8482c">Teams channel!</a> The Admin Team and your Instructors are here to help you throughout the process, not just during Office Hours. </p>
    <p>Also, if you have not started the take-home work yet, </p>
    <h2>START!</h2>
    <p>This is not content you can skim through at the last minute. It will take time and it is essential to your success in all subsequent modules. </p>
    <p>We’re looking forward to seeing all of you next Thursday! </p>
